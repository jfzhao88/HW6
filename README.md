“Node is a bunch of sugar on top of a very complex virtual machine written by Google called V8” – Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.js
	Based on the introduction video and node.js tutorial, I have come to some understanding of node.js. Advantage of Node.js: “Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices are meant to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations.” Asynchronous programming is: "A single thread event system like Node.JS works by placing events in a queue and processing them one by one calling the appropriate event handler."
		Node.js was created because concurrency is difficult in many server-side programming languages, and often leads to poor performance. Concurrency in programming means: “property of program, algorithm, or problem decomposability into order-independent or partially-ordered components or units. This means that even if the concurrent units of the program, algorithm, or problem are executed out-of-order or in partial order, the result will remain determinate.”
			Non-blocking IO: “Node.js are designed to be non-blocking (commands execute in parallel, and use callbacks to signal completion or failure) versus PHP which, blocks functions until completion (commands execute only after previous commands have completed)”
				Overall, Node.js adds more flexible elements to server-side programming with all the features and makes programming easier and more efficient.
